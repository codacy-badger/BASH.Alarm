.SH EXAMPLES
Following examples were created to help you get started.
.TP
.I Testing Sound

Sound of a countdown, interval, or an alarm can be easily tested prior to initialization using a "--test" flag.

\fBalarm --test -a\fR
.TP
.I Countdown

In this example, we are starting a 10s countdown, after which a generic alarm sound will be played.

\fBalarm -t 10s -c\fR
.TP
.I Interval

Starting an interval is just as easy, in this example we are starting an interval that will play a generic alarm sound after each minute.

\fBalarm -t 1m -i\fR

Alternatively, you can start an interval with varying time. First interval will trigger an alarm in 1m, second in 2m, and so on indefinitely.

\fBalarm -t 1m,2m,3m -i\fR

\fBNote:\fR Keep in mind that intervals run idefinitely so in order to stop them you need to press CTRL + C or kill it using your prefered method.
.TP
.I Alarm

To create an alarm that will be triggered at ex. 07:00 AM you simply need to issue the following command.

\fBalarm -t "07:00 AM" -a\fR
.TP
.I Listing Alarms

Listing previously created alarms can be done using the "-l" flag.

\fBalarm -l\fR
.TP
.I Removing Alarms

Appropriate CRON job is created whenever you add an alarm, which may be a hassle to remove. To easily remove an alarm, simply determine the index of an alarm (using the listing feature) and pass it using the "-r" flag.

\fBalarm -r 1\fR
.TP
.I Disabling Alarms

In some cases you would want to temporarily disable an alarm, which can be achieved using the "-b" flag.

\fBalarm -b 1\fR
.TP
.I Enabling Alarms

In a similar fashion, you can enable previously disabled alarm using the "-e" flag.

\fBalarm -e 1\fR
.TP
.I Initialization Delay

Sometimes you may want to start a countdown after a slight delay, in this example we are starting a 10m countdown with a 10 second delay. Like before, a generic alarm sound will be palyed after the countdown.

\fBalarm -t 10m -d 10 -c\fR
.TP
.I Command Execution

Usually, you would want to execute a certain command after a countdown, interval or an alarm. This example shows you how to do just that, execute an arbitrary command after a 10s countdown.

\fBalarm -t 10s -c "echo 'Hello World!'"\fR
.TP
.I Alternative Sound Effect

You can easily change the default sound effect by providing an ID of a built-in sound effect.

\fBalarm -t 10s -s 2 -c\fR

Or you can, alternatively, just point to your own sound effect.

\fBalarm -t 10s -s /path/to/your/folder/effect.wav -c\fR
.TP
.I Sound Volume

Flag "-v" is used to temporarily change the master volume during the alarm to a percentage of your choosing. It is a great way to avoid missing an alarm.

\fBalarm -t 10s -v 100 -c\fR
.TP
.I Displaying Messages

You can display a custom message when the alarm is triggered using the "-m" flag.

\fBalarm -t 10s -m "My alarm message!" -c\fR
.TP
.I Global Alarms

If you want to set a countdown, interval, or an alarm that will trigger for all logged-in users, you should use the "--global" flag.

\fBalarm --global -t 1m -c\fR
.TP
.I Dependency Installation

Alarm doesn't have a lot of dependencies but, in any case, there's a way to install them quickly and effortlessly.

\fBalarm --install\fR
